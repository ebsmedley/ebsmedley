Look for me at SfN 2019!

Poster info: 324.07 / W8 - Circuit directionality for motivation: Lateral accumbens-pallidum, but not pallidum-accumbens, connections regulate motivational attraction to reward cues

If you can't make it, stay tuned to my website, I'll be sure to post the poster following the conference!
