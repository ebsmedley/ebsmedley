## Research Interests
* Motivation
* Reward
* Addiction
* Sign-Tracking
* Pavlovian Conditioning

My academic career has been shaped by an interest in understanding motivated behavior and the possibility for interventions in motivation disorders in humans. To better understand people and their motivations, I began my undergraduate degree at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) seeking a dual major in Psychology and Justice Studies and a minor in Spanish. I sought to deepen my understanding of people and what drives them to act. However, upon taking a Psychobiology course, I was instantly curious in the underlying neural mechanisms that contribute to motivation and the translational potential of that knowledge. After this course, I became a Neuroscience major and began conducting research with Dr. Robert Mair and Dr. Brett Gibson probing the thalamocortical connections underlying goal-oriented behavior. I was captivated by in vivo electrophysiology and the ability to watch cells responding to behavior in real time. With this experience, I gained more independence as a researcher and began to ask more questions about behavior, motivation, and hedonics. These questions have motivated my pursuit of a Ph.D. at Dartmouth College in the laboratory of Dr. Kyle Smith where I have focused my hypotheses on ventral pallidum (VP) contributions to cue-driven motivation. Specifically, I want to know how cues in the environment contribute to motivation, and explicitly how sequential cues work in concert to stimulate behavioral responses. To this end, I have probed the relationship between sequential lever cues in a Pavlovian autoshaping procedure which has culminated in two published works (Smedley & Smith 2018a, 2018b). I have also explored the connections between VP and the understudied lateral accumbens shell (NAcLSh) and their contributions to Pavlovian autoshaping responses, specifically sign-tracking responses, by inhibiting these projections using targeted chemogenetic techniques (Smedley, DiLeo, and Smith, 2019).
